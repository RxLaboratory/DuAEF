# DuAEF
Duduf After Effects ExtendScript Framework

## What's this?

***DuAEF*** is a set of **classes**, **methods** and **tools** to ease the scripting process in **After Effects**, as long as adding features (like [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), or [json](http://json.org/)) not available in After Effects/ExtendScript.
It is very easy to use and **[documented](https://duaef.rxlab.guide)**.

## How to use the framework in an After Effects script?

Just include the framework in your script with this simple code:

    #include DuAEF.jsxinc
    
After this, all objects and methods from DuAEF will be available, in [the DuAEF namespace](https://duaef.rxlab.guide).
