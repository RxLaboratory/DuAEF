- [DuQuant](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF/blob/master/libs/DuQuantLib.jsxinc) is an interface to pngquant, a powerful tool to add lossy compression to PNG files, very useful for web design, proxies, or any other case where lightweight PNG images are needed.
- [DuRenderer](https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuAEF/blob/master/libs/DuRendererLib.jsxinc) is an interface to the After Effects renderer, both in the UI or as a background renderer. It also provides PNG lossy compression with pngquant and will provide FFmpeg support to add formats to the standard After Effects renderer.
